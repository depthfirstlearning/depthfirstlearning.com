# Depth First Learning

This is the open source code repository running [Depth First Learning](http://www.depthfirstlearning.com/about/), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Tale](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/tale/) theme.

Start this locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Contributing

We're looking for people to help make DFL better. Here are some ways you can help:
* Run a study group based on one of our guides, and let us know about it. What worked well? What didn't?
* Check out the [open issues](http://github.com/depthfirstlearning/depthfirstlearning.com/issues), where we keep track of improvements that we'd like to see.
* Tell us what our guides are missing, or where they may be confusing, by filing [issues](http://github.com/depthfirstlearning/depthfirstlearning.com/issues/new).
* Improve our guides, by filing [pull requests](http://github.com/depthfirstlearning/depthfirstlearning.com/pulls). We are especially looking for [Colabs](http://colab.corp.google.com/) with lots of explanatory text to explain and reproduce results.  All of the content is stored in markdown under the `posts/` directory.
* Add guides for other papers! Reach out to us at depthfirstlearning@gmail.com and let's talk.
