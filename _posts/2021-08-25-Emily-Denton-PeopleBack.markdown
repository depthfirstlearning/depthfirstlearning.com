TODO !

[Tasks, stability, architecture, and compute: Training more effective learned optimizers, and using them to train themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11243)
was a paper from September, 2020, by [Luke Metz](http://lukemetz.com/) and co. It is another
step towards replacing hand-designed features with learned functions, this time the
optimizer. This has been a three year journey for Luke; listen to him describe what
he's learned along the way and where are the pain points, from research to
engineering.
