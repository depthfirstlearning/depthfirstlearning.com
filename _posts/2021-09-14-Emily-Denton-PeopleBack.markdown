blurb: "[Audio] What are the histories, values, and norms of a dataset? This is an important question for practitioners to understand because datasets serve as the root of what we as a field care about. Listen to Emily Denton explain how her team is thinking about this problem and the four research questions they pose in this paper."

[Bringing the people back in: Contesting benchmark machine learning datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07399) was a paper from July, 2020, by [Emily Denton](https://cephaloponderer.com/) and team.
It is an interogation of how datasets in machine learning are made and how they influence the field. The work motivates the need for genealogical methods for datasets so that we can trace their history and ensure that users are sufficiently aware of what biases they introduce into resulting infrastructure. This is an ongoing journey for Emily in her blossoming career. Listen to her describe that journey here.
