blurb: "[Audio] When training our models, why not learn the optimizer as well? Listen to Luke
        Metz explain how he's spent the past three years working towards this goal.
        He focuses here on his paper from late 2020 and asks the question what happens
        when the optimizers train themselves."

[Tasks, stability, architecture, and compute: Training more effective learned optimizers, and using them to train themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11243)
was a paper from September, 2020, by [Luke Metz](http://lukemetz.com/) and co. It is another
step towards replacing hand-designed features with learned functions, this time the
optimizer. This has been a three year journey for Luke; listen to him describe what
he's learned along the way and where are the pain points, from research to
engineering.
