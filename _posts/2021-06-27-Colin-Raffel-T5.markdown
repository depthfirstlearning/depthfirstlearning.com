[T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) by [Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/) 
et al is an important work in the NLP literature. The 
idea behind it was to perform a gigantic study on a wide array of methods and 
scientifically assess what worked. They then combined those working methods into 
a single model called ... T5. It performs well in every common NLP task, from 
summarization to translation to question answering.
